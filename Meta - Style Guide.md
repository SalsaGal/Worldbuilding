# Style Guide

## Should I make a page?

Almost everything should have a page. The general rule of thumb throughout this style guide is to act like wikipedia. If it isn't a tiny thing only relevant to the contents of one specific article, it should have its own page.

## What if I don't know everything?

Text in *italics* is information that is either not decided upon or completely missing.
