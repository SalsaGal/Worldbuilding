# Cosmology

## The star

*The star* is a red dwarf star with a mass of approximately 0.1237 M<sub>☉</sub>. Its effective temperature is approximately 3100K, and it is a class M main-sequence star.

## The planet

*The planet* is orbiting *the star* at a distance of 0.04 AU, has a mass of 0.62 M<sub>⊕</sub>, and has a radius of 0.56 R<sub>⊕</sub>. Its surface gravity is 1.1g. It orbits *the star* at a rate of 1 rotation per 6 days (as in, Earth days) and is tidally locked to the star. The axial tilt of *the planet* is approximately 5 degrees due to numerous ice comets having collided with it, giving areas not on the equator a day/night cycle the same length as that of the year, and the effect of which is amplified proportional to distance from the equator.
