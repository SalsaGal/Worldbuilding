# Cosmology

## The star

*The star* is a red dwarf star with a mass of approximately 0.1237 M<sub>☉</sub>. Its temperature is approximately 3100K, and it is a class M main-sequence star.

## The planet

*The planet* is orbiting *the star* at a distance of 0.04 AU and has a radius of *X* R<sub>⊕</sub>. It orbits *the star* at a rate of 1 rotation per 6 days (as in, Earth days) and is tidally locked to the star. The axial tilt of *the planet* is approximately 5 degrees *as a result of something? Perhaps numerous ice comets crashed into the planet giving it liquid water and this tilt*, giving areas not on the equator a day/night cycle the same length as that of the year, and the effect of which is amplified proportional to distance from the equator.
